### Instructions
This repo contains sample Terraform and Cloudformation scripts for testing. The scripts are for RDS, EC2 and VPC, and they are for both Terraform and Cloudformation. They are supplied with their sample .json (for CF) and .csv (for TF) input files as well. Along with that, there is a KEYS folder, that contains the input samples for verification.

This repo has been used to demonstrate a DevOps use case of Jira/Jenkins integration. Check out a very detailed POC here: https://medium.com/@shrut_terminator/devops-usecase-jira-jenkins-integration-4051413446a9
